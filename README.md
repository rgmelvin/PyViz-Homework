Housing Rental Analysis for San Francisco
In this challenge, my job was to use data visualization skills, including aggregation, interactive visualizations, and geospatial analysis, to find properties in the San Francisco market that are viable investment opportunities.

In this assignment I created a visualization by using hvPlot and GeoViews. Additionally, I read the sfo_neighborhoods_census_data.csv file from the Resources folder into the notebook and created the DataFrame used in the analysis.

The main task in this Challenge was to visualize and analyze the real-estate data in a Jupyter notebook. 

I completed the following tasks:

Calculated and plotted the housing units per year.

Calculated and plotted the average prices per square foot for the housing units.

Compared average prices of rent and sales by neighborhood.

Built an interactive neighborhood map of rents and sales prices.
